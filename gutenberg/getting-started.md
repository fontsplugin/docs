# Getting Started

Fonts Plugin has native support the new Block Editor (Gutenberg).

If your theme has built in support for fonts, you will see a 'Font' control when a paragraph or heading is selected:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (43).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Follow the relevant links to add [Google Fonts](../advanced-settings/load-fonts-only.md), [Adobe Fonts](../integrations/adobe-fonts.md) and [Custom Uploads](../custom-font-uploads/custom-font-uploads.md) to the dropdown list.

If your theme doesn't support fonts natively, you can still use our Fonts Block.

#### Google Fonts block

Simply add a new block and search for `fonts` or `google fonts`:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)

The Google Fonts block has the following attributes:

* Block Type (Paragraph, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6)
* Font (900+ Google Fonts)
* Variants
* Font Size (px)
* Line Height
* Color
* Alignment (Left, Right, Center)

Regular paragraphs and heading blocks can also be [transformed](transformations.md) into Google Font blocks.
