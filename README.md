# Introduction

Fonts Plugin is the number one [Google Fonts Plugin for WordPress](https://fontsplugin.com). It has been downloaded over 1,500,000 times and is active on 100,000+ websites.

Within minutes you can transform the typography of your website using the easy-to-use interface.

Fonts can be set globally across your entire website, or for maximum control you can customize each line of text individually.

Fonts Plugin works with both the [Classic Editor](classic-editor/getting-started.md) and [Gutenberg (Block Editor)](https://docs.fontsplugin.com/gutenberg/getting-started).

For users that require fonts that are not included in the Google Fonts library, support for [Custom Font Uploads](https://docs.fontsplugin.com/custom-font-uploads/custom-font-uploads) and [Adobe Fonts](https://docs.fontsplugin.com/integrations/adobe-fonts) is included.
