# Updating Fonts Plugin Pro

**Error: "Upload Failed: Download Failed. Unauthorized"**

Because Fonts Plugin Pro is a premium plugin, your license key and website URL are checked against our database before the plugin is updated. Here's how to fix the "Unauthorized" error.

First, check you have entered and activated your license key within wp-admin, under Fonts Plugin â†’ License:

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)

If you license key is showing as active then the next step is to verify the website URL is correct in your FontsPlugin.com account.

Login to your account here: [https://fontsplugin.com/account/](https://fontsplugin.com/account/)

If you don't have an account you can [register here](https://fontsplugin.com/account-registration/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Creating an account will grant you permanent access to your files and license keys.
{% endhint %}

If you've forgotten your password, you can [reset it here](https://fontsplugin.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword).

Once you have successfully logged in, click '_View Licenses_' and then '_Manage Sites_'.

If an incorrect URL is shown, you can deactivate the license and add the correct URL instead:

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (35).png>)

**Still not working?**

If you have completed the above steps and still can't update the plugin, please [contact us](https://fontsplugin.com/contact) and we'll be happy to help resolve the issue.
