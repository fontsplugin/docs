# Clear Fonts Cache

Adding and removing font-families and font weights automatically clears the fonts cache. However, it can also be cleared manually.

Navigate to `Appearance` → `Customize`→ `Fonts Plugin` → `Debugging`

Click the 'Clear Cache' button and the plugin will do all the work in the background. There's nothing else to do!
