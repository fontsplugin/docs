# Manual Update

If you are unable to or don't want to use WordPress' built-in updater it's possible to update Fonts Plugin Pro manually.

The plugin file (_fonts-plugin-pro.zip_) is available inside your account here: [https://fontsplugin.com/account/](https://fontsplugin.com/account/)

First, you will need to login to your account, if you don't already have an account you can [register here](https://fontsplugin.com/account-registration/).
