# Beaver Builder

To use Google Fonts in the 'Beaver Builder' plugin, you must first tell the plugin which fonts you want to use.

* In wp-admin, navigate to `Appearance` → `Customize`
* Click `Google Fonts` → `Advanced Settings` → `Load Fonts Only`
* Add the fonts you want to use
* Click `Publish`

Now when using the 'Text Editor' block within the Beaver Builder you will have access to the fonts you have chosen (as well as some system fonts):
