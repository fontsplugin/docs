# Custom Elements

`Appearance` → `Customize`→ `Fonts Plugin` → `Custom Elements`

Custom Elements allow you to build Typography settings for any element on your website.

Custom Elements can be created under `Google Fonts` → `Custom Elements`.

**Before creating Custom Elements it's important that you save any other changes you have made in the Customizer.** This is because when you press 'Save Changes' to generate the Custom Elements controls, the Customizer will refresh and lose any unsaved settings.

The `Selectors` field accepts any valid [CSS Selectors.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction\_to\_CSS/Selectors) That means there is no element on your website that is off-limits.

A Selector can target a single element, or multiple elements separated by commas. For example:

```css
.widget-title, #form, table, h1
```

Once you have created your Custom Elements. Press `Save Changes`. You will then be able to customize your Elements under `Google Fonts` → `Advanced Settings` → `Custom Elements`.
